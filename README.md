# CNN-with-non-linear-metric

This project is about implementaion of CNN on various datasets like MNIST, Oxford flowers and CMU face images dataset, using non-linear metrics. The non-linear metrics used are:
1.Neighborhood component analysis(NCA)
2.Information theoretic metric learning(ITML)
3.Sparse determinant metric learning(SDML)
4.Kullback-leilber divergence
5.Logarithmic hyperbolic cosine
6.Categorical cross entropy

I've compared the performance of the CNN using non-parametric statistical tests.
